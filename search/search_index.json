To use the widget collection Close Automation Studio Download the folder 'brXtended' and copy it in your Automation Studio project into the folder '\\Logical\\mappView\\Widgets'. Start Automation Studio The new widget group 'brXtended' is now available in the toolbox. The widgets can also be found by selecting the category or using the search field. If the widget is an extension of an existing widget it may have the same name. Make sure to pick the correct one. Remember Inherited widgets do not automatically adopt the themes from their parents. For example, the customized toggle switch does change the look when the standard theme is changed because the name of the customized widget \"widgets.brXtended.ToggleSwitch\" does not exist in this theme. To adopt the look and feel from the parent you have edit the style files from the theme and duplicate all entries for \"widgets.brease.ToggleSwitch\" and then assign them to \"widgets.brXtended.ToggleSwitch\"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"revision.html","text":"29.03.2023 The widgets are now compiled against mapp 5.21.

Windows / Linux Due to browser security restrictions the screen access is blocked for standard HTTP connections which is the default for mappView. mappView must be changed to HTTPS access or the HTTP URL must be added to the browser as an exception. Use the following line in the browser URL to access the flag chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure Add the mappView URL and enable the flag.

B&R Panels Due to browser security restrictions the screen access is blocked for standard HTTP connections which is the default for mappView. mappView must be changed to HTTPS access or the HTTP URL must be added to the browser as an exception. On B&R panels the screen capture must be enabled in the panel settings. This option is available starting with firmware 1.6.x.

Screenshot2Plc This action creates a screenshot and saves it to the PLC. This action needs two parameters filePath - Full path to the screenshot image including the filename and extension.
